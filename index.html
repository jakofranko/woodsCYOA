		<h1>The Woods</h1>
		<h2>a short, choose your own adventure</h2>
		<h3>by Jake Franklin</h3>
		<div  align="center"><a id="begin" href="#">Begin</a></div>
		<div id="1" class="hidden">
			You sit up with a start. Disoriented and confused, you find yourself sitting in a forest of oaks and pecan trees, leafless from the winterchill that has ended only recently. It's pleasant outside, the sky is a deep dark blue of a shade that can only be painted by a full moon and stars unhindered by city street lamps. You are not sure how you got here. Is this a dream? Did you sleep walk out into the woods surrounding your house? That must be it. But what woke you? As you get to your feet, you are swept with a feeling of...you're not sure what. Intrigue? You've never thought about the woods surrounding your house. What's back there? As you contemplate walking further into the woods, you feel a twinge of hesitation; maybe you should go back. Pensiveness fills your body. 
			<br/>
			<a href="#" id="to1_1">Venture into the woods, why not do some exploring?</a>
			<br/>
			<a href="#" id="to2">Make your way back home, it's creepy that you're out here and don't know why.</a>
		</div>
			<div id="1_1" class="hidden">Filled with a sense of apprehension, you start off into the woods. You walk along the path, trees start to encroach overhead more and more as you journey onwards. Sounds of the night are strangely absent: there is no wind, there are no sounds of animals rustling amongst the foliage, no night calls, no insect-chirping. You notice this silence slowly, and once you fully notice the absence of sound, fear creeps up your neck. You are about to turn back when you hear music, faintly in the distance. It is unlike anything you've heard before. It sounds like there are many flute-like instruments, and the melody is beautiful and haunting. You question the malice of anything able to produce something so lovely, but you also question the presence of anyone out in the woods at this time of day. 
				<br/>
				<a href="#" id="to1_1_1">Go toward the music and investigate; it sounds lovely.</a> 
				<br/>
				<a href="#" id="to1_1_2">Head back the way you came, nothing good happens after dark.</a>
			</div>
				<div id="1_1_1" class="hidden">
					Compelled by the mysterious music, you veer off the path and make your way slowly toward the music you hear. Moving through the bushes forces you to focus on your feet and are startled by a shriek followed by sudden flapping. You jump and try to find the source of the sound, and manage to catch a glimpse of some creature you don't recognise disappear behind the thick branches of the trees that enclose you. 
					<br/>
					<a href="#" id="to1_1_1a">Next.</a>
				</div>	
				<div id="1_1_1a" class="hidden">
					As you push forward, you trip on a root and fall flat on your face. When you stand up, you realize that you have fallen into a clearing of some kind; the ground is clear and the trees encircle the area thickly. The only opening is across the clearing, where trees arch over a path like a gateway. The music seems to be coming from through there, but you can't see anything much beyond the opening, which is dark and slightly ominous. The trees open up to a dark sky filled with the milky silver of the moon, which is bright and shining down into the circle. Apprehension fills your chest, and you question the choices you have made so far. 
					<br/>
					<a href="#" id="to1_1_1_1">Continue through the archway, you've come this far and might as well.</a>
					<br/>
					<a href="#" id="to1_1_1_2">Turn around, this was a bad idea.</a>
				</div>
					<div id="1_1_1_1" class="hidden">
						You stand and dart across the clearing very quickly, not wanting to be seen for some reason, but your steeled nerves are sufficient to get you through the archway. Darkness envelops you and you yelp in pain as something lashes you across the face. You reach up and experience the slick sensation of blood on your skin, as you throw your other arm out to defend yourself. There is no sound. Nothing at all. The music has stopped. You remain very still and crouch down, but as your eyes adjust to the darkness you realize that you walked straight into a thorny branch, which is what scratched your face. But still, the music has stopped. The beginnings of terror creep up your chest and into your throat. You continue to move forward, and as soon as you make your first step, you catch the music again, this time more distant. It's different this time though, happier. You reason that the first song must have ended and that was why the music stopped. Heartened, you move along the path, struggling to see in the even denser wood beyond the arch. 
						<br/>

					</div>
					<div id="1_1_1_1a" class="hidden">
						As you walk cautiously along the path, you begin to notice a scent; it's sweet and floral, and brings back hazy memories of dreams long forgotten. You begin to see lightning bugs, and the occasional winged beast take flight. You can't place the species. Some have wings like bats but with large crested heads, and others are feathered but have heads shaped like soft forest mammals. Glowing eyes peep out from the thick brush on either side of you, and the shapes behind some of them do not look benign. The path ahead looks dark, and just when you think it's about to end, two enormous white globes turn around, attached to a gigantic, furry monster. You reel in terror, and notice that it's body is round and formless. It has large, pointy ears, tree-trunk-sized arms and short, stubby legs that emerge subtly from the ovalure, furred shape of its body. It seems to be holding onto a string, as a child would hold onto a balloon, but you can't see what the string is attached to as it goes up toward the moon. The beast blinks at you and makes a strange grunt followed by a high-pitched fluttering sound. 
						<br/>
						<a href="#" id="to1_1_1_1_2">Turn and run for your life.</a>
						<br/><a href="#" id="to1_1_1_1_1">Greet the beast soothingly, to assure you mean it no harm.</a>
					</div>
						<div id="1_1_1_1_1" class="hidden">
							You greet the beast, standing non-threateningly and trying to not make eye-contact. The beast grunts again, and blinks at you in what seems to be a friendly way. You ask the beast what it is. It pauses for a moment, tilting its head side-ways and looking at you quizzically. You begin to think it's not going to answer. Why would it after all? There's no way it understands you. But suddenly it makes a loud, trilling sound, and it hops up and down a couple of times, shaking the ground with each thud of its large body hitting the earth. Once it stops hopping, it looks up and tugs on the string. You follow its look, and don't see anything but the bright, full moon. It looks unusually large. You think you see it bounce a little bit, but blink your eyes, unbelievingly. The beast seems to notice your incredulity, and walks over to you. It's tread is strangely light, and when it is standing right in front of you, it offers you the string. 
							<br/>
							<a href="#" id="to1_1_1_1_1_1">Take the string, you might as well be polite.</a>
							<br/>
							<a href="#" id="to1_1_1_1_1_2">You say no thank-you, unsure of its intentions and worried for your safety.</a>
						</div>
							<div id="1_1_1_1_1_1" class="hidden">
								You take the string, and are immediately pulled upwards. You hold on tight and begin to rise slowly toward the moon. The beast looks up at you, amused. You start to panic, and just as you decide to let go, the beast jumps up and grabs the string next to you, and you both sink back to the earth. After you land, the beast unleashes series of grunts and trills, and when it sees that you don't understand, it draws you a series of pictures on the ground. They depict a tall, slender figure with many arms, and the slender figure is following another figure walking through the woods. Then it depicts a group of creatures holding strange, long poles and you realize that these are the creatures that were making the music you heard. The music seems to ward off the slender figure, and the last frame depicts the other figure talking with a depiction of what could only be the large, furry beast. Confused, you begin to realize that you need to get back to your home. You nod your head at the beast and thanking it and begin to explain that you need to go. Suddenly the beast grabs you and before you realize what's happening you are both flying through the air. Terrified, you cling to the furry underbelly of the beast, who is holding onto you with one hand, while grasping the string with the other, which seems to be pulling you both through the air. After a few exhilarating minutes, you begin to descend, and when the beast finally puts you down, you realize that you are in front of your house. The beast blinks at you with its large, glowing-white eyes, touches your head gently with its huge paw, and then takes off back towards the woods at an alarming speed.

							<div id="1_1_1_1_1_1a" class="hidden">
								Exhausted, you turn around and head inside, not sure what to believe and completely bewildered at the night's events. You are filled with equal parts exhilaration and fear, and find the lock on your door and the warm light of your house to be extremely comforting. <br/>
								<a href="#" id="toending1">Next.</a>

							<!-- to ending 1 -->
							<div id="1_1_1_1_1_2" class="hidden">
								You refuse the string, and pull away from the intimidating beast. It makes a series of short trills, and blinks at you in a hurt way, and proffers you the string again, but you say that you couldn't take the string from it, and begin to back away. Suddenly the beasts eyes, glowing like white spotlights, turn a blood red, and it makes a soul-chilling howl that deafens your ears. You run. You run faster than you knew you could run, down the path and back toward the clearing. You hear flapping wings, screeches of unearthly animals and the feet of large animals behind you, with a steady, earth-shaking thud-thud-thud that could only be the large beast running after you. You see the tree-arch in front of you, and re-double your speed. Suddenly, the sound of the animals and the thudding stop, and the only sound you hear are the rapid crunches of your feet on the forest dirt. 
								<br/>
								<a href="#" id="to1_1_1_1_1_2_1">Stop and look behind you.</a>
								<br/><a href="#" id="to1_1_1_1_1_2_2">Continue running as fast as you can.</a>
							</div>
								<div id="1_1_1_1_1_2_1" class="ending hidden">
									You skid to a halt and look behind you. The way you came is completely empty. And silent. Terror now has you full in its chilling, burning grasp, and just as you are about to turn back around, you catch a glimpse of a tall, slender figure. You start to cough and feel the strength leave your limbs. When you glance up, you see that the figure has moved closer to you. You attempt to move away, but double over as another series of coughs racks your body. The last thing you see is a pair of black boots, and as you glance up you see an inhumanly tall figure of a man with many arms, and with no face.
								</div>
								<div id="1_1_1_1_1_2_2" class="hidden">
									You don't hesitate for even a fraction of a second, and continue your healing journey through the archway, through the clearing, and through the underbrush back the way you came. Just when you think you're lost, you stumble out onto the path where you veered off when you first heard that other-worldly music. You continue to run as fast as you can back toward your house, and after what seems like an eternity, you finally reach your door. You burst in, slam and lock the door behind you, and turn on all the lights that you can. Wide-eyed, disbelieving and terrified, you stay awake for hours, as the adrenalin makes its way through your system. After a while, you begin to question if you had really seen the things you did, and by the time sleep finds you, you are almost convinced that it was all in your head.

								</div>
						<div id="1_1_1_1_2" class="hidden">
							You spin on your heel and bolt back the way you came, terrified. The music continues, but you hear the indignant cries of the other-wordly creatures around you. Fear taking you more fully, you sprint back to the archway and into the clearing.

						<div id="alt1_1_2" class="hidden">As you push back through the woods the music gradually stops, and the woods grow eerily quiet. You tear through the last bits of the thicket onto the path you veered off from, and you think you hear the music start again, this time a bit happier. This sooths you, but after walking a ways back up the path toward your house, you begin to feel dread fill the pit of your stomach. Your ears start to ring, and you throw a few fearful looks behind you, imagining that you see dark, tall figures here and there. <br/><a href="#" id="toalt1_2a">Next.</a></div><!-- to branch alt1_2a -->
						<div id="alt1_2a" class="hidden">You soon come to the place where you woke, and break out into a cold sweat as you ponder what in the world caused you to sleep-walk out here.

							You come up to the door, and walk inside, the door unlocked. Things look as you left it, but you feel uneasy. After closing the door, you search the house for anything unusual. You look in your closets, and under the bed, and behind furniture. Nothing. You lock the front door, and go to bed. Sleep plays hard-to-get tonight, but eventually slumber overcomes you.

The footage stops and “END OF TAPE” appears on the preview screen. Severely unnerved, you shut the camera off and stand thinking for a while in the middle of your living room. What in the world was that? Is there a stalker around your house? Are you in danger?

		<div id="ending1" class="hidden">You awake in your bed, the sun-shining outside. You remeber a strange dream full of strange creatures, and a moon-beast who held the moon like some balloon. It makes you smile, and you get ready for work. As you go to take off your clothes, which for some reason you slept in, you notice some long, black and grey hairs that cling to your clothing. Where did those come from? Without another thought, you take your clothes off and breathe in sharply as your shirt grazes your forehead. You look in the mirror and notice a large scratch across your face. The color leaves your face as you ponder what this means.<br/><br/><span class="ending"><a href="#" id="to1">END</a></span></div>
